# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a forth year Int. Ph.D. student in Dr. [Manas Kar](https://manasmkar.wixsite.com/math)'s [Inverse problem Group](https://manasmkar.wixsite.com/math/research-group) at [IISER Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in). I received my B.Sc from Department of Mathematics, New Art's, Commerce and Science College, Ahmednagar in 2017 and M.S from Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal in 2021.

From 2019, I have been focusing on mathematical aspects of inverse problems related to partial differential equations. In inverse problems, one needs to recover an unknown parameter of a system from external observations. One of my main research topics is inverse Calder√≥n problem for different kinds of partial differential equations (PDEs). The problem asks to determine the conductivity of an object from the voltage and current measured on its boundary.
These kinds of inverse problems have fundamental importance in Industrial and medical Imaging as well as in connection to geophysical problems.
